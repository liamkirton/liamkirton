Hey :wave:, I'm Liam [![GitHub][1.2]][1] [![LinkedIn][2.2]][2] [![Twitter][3.2]][3] [![Web][4.2]][4]

I'm currently a Principal Security Researcher at [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com/) [Security Research (MSecR)](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/microsoft-security-intelligence/),
where I work on R&D related to Threat Intelligence and Detection for
[Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (EDR)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/security/business/endpoint-security/microsoft-defender-endpoint) and [Windows Defender Antivirus](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/comprehensive-security).

I write a lot of [Python :snake:](https://python.org/) with
[Pandas :panda_face:](https://pandas.pydata.org/) in
[Jupyter Notebooks :rocket:](https://jupyter.org/) to mine interesting security events from trillions of daily signals held in
[Kusto :cloud::ocean:](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/).

Here are some recent spare-time projects:

* I've recently completed a [Postgraduate Diploma in Mathematics](https://www.open.ac.uk/postgraduate/qualifications/e23) on the way to the [MSc](https://www.open.ac.uk/postgraduate/qualifications/f04).
* I'm currently (2022-23) studying for a [Graduate Certificate in Theoretical Statistics and Probability](https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/statistics/certificates/certificate-in-theoretical-statistics-probability-s04).
* [fractal-cuda](https://github.com/liamkirton/fractal-cuda) - render deep [Mandebrot sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) on the GPU with CUDA.
* [8bitcpu](https://github.com/liamkirton/8bitcpu) - my [Ben Eater 8-bit breadboard computer](https://eater.net/8bit/) with assembler and emulator. Requires
[at28c256](https://github.com/liamkirton/at28c256) Arduino EEPROM programmer.

I spent 15 years working on Vulnerability Research and Windows Internals, and here are some ancient obsolete Windows security tools:

* [scant](https://github.com/liamkirton/scant) and [scamp](https://github.com/liamkirton/scamp)
* [lsppyfilter](https://github.com/liamkirton/lsppyfilter)
