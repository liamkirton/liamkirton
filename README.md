Hey, I'm Liam [![GitHub][1.2]][1] [![LinkedIn][2.2]][2] [![Web][3.2]][3]

I'm currently a Principal Security Research Lead at [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com/) in the [Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/topic/threat-intelligence),
where I work on R&D related to Threat Intelligence and Detection across a wide range of MS products.

I write a lot of [Python :snake:](https://python.org/), [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) and [Rust :crab:](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to mine interesting security events from
trillions of daily signals held in [Kusto :cloud::ocean:](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/). I particularly specialise in writing fast and efficient [KQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/).
