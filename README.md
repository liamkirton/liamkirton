Hey :wave:. I'm Liam, a security researcher and developer.

I'm currently a Principal Software Engineer at [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com/) in the
[Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC)](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/microsoft-security-intelligence/), where I work on detection technologies. I write a lot of [Python :snake:](https://python.org/[) with [Pandas :panda_face:](https://pandas.pydata.org/) in
[Jupyter Notebooks :rocket:](https://jupyter.org/) to mine [Kusto :cloud::ocean:](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/).

In the old days, I mostly did Vulnerability Research, and a bunch of my old C/C++ Windows security tools are available under my repos (e.g. [scant](https://github.com/liamkirton/scant), [lsppyfilter](https://github.com/liamkirton/lsppyfilter), ...) - all obsolete!

In my spare time, I love to learn and mess with new things, as well as slowly work on my [MSc](https://www.open.ac.uk/postgraduate/qualifications/f04). Here are
some recent projects:

* [fractal-cuda](https://github.com/liamkirton/fractal-cuda) - render deep [Mandebrot sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) on the GPU with CUDA.
* [8bitcpu](https://github.com/liamkirton/8bitcpu) - my [Ben Eater 8-bit breadboard computer](https://eater.net/8bit/) with assembler and emulator. Requires
[at28c256](https://github.com/liamkirton/at28c256) Arduino EEPROM programmer.
